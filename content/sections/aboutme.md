I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Michigan State University and a member of the 2025â€“26 job market.

I am a dual citizen of the United States and Greece and am seeking opportunities in academia, government, policy research, and the private sector in both the U.S. and European Union.

My fields are Applied Microeconomics with a focus on Environmental and Urban Economics.

My job market paper examines how mandatory flood risk disclosure laws for rental properties affect rental housing markets, rent prices, and sorting patterns in Texas. I study these dynamics using proprietary housing data, geospatial risk information, and natural experiments around policy implementation.

More broadly, I am interested in housing markets, climate adaptation, disaster economics, policy timing, and the economics of artificial intelligence.
