    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I am a PhD Candidate in Environmental, Urban, and Applied Microeconomics at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>My research focuses on how mandatory flood risk disclosure laws for rental properties affect rental housing markets, rent prices, and sorting patterns.</p>
<p>My dissertation examines these dynamics in two U.S. states, Indiana and Texas, leveraging proprietary housing data, geospatial risk information, and natural experiments around policy implementation.</p>
<p>More broadly, I am interested in the growing reliance on rental housing, climate adaptation, and the role of real estate markets in shaping household exposure to natural hazards. My work explores how people respond to new information, the extent to which they value it, and how state and federal policies can both support adaptation and potentially reinforce existing inequities.</p>

<p>My research experience spans topics in environmental and development economics,  neighborhood dynamics, poverty, and forced migration. Across these roles, I have supported faculty and supervisors alike through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of results for presentations and publications using Stata, R, and ArcGIS Pro, often working with large administrative datasets and spatial data.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I was born in the United States and grew up in Greece, which sparked my love for cultures, languages, and stories early on. I&rsquo;m an avid reader and traveler, and I’m happiest when exploring new places, meeting new people, and learning how others live and think. I’m also a huge movie fan and quite possibly the biggest foodie you&rsquo;ll ever meet — I truly believe you can’t understand a place without understanding its food culture.</p>
<p>I love swimming, and being by the water brings me the deepest sense of peace. Whether it’s the sea, a lake, or a quiet river, I always feel most at home near the water.</p>
